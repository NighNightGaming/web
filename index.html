			<p>As we continue to develop forward, this area will contain more information about projects.
			</p>
			<p> However, currently we are focusing on developing our sister group, <a href="mailto:verynicewebdesign@nighnight.com">Very Nice Web Design Group</a>, in order to generate revenue so that we may have the liberty to experiment with innovative games.
			</p> 
			<p>Moreover, we have left behind Maze Maker as a clear step foward towards more mature development practices and ambitions. 
			That being said, you can still find it at our <a href="https://github.com/nighnightgaming/"> github address.</a>

			<p>Nigh Night Gaming Collective (NNGC) is an open group of 
developers and artists of varying skills focusing on 
original, interesting, and, most importantly, fun game development.</p>

			<p>NNGC is dedicated to openness and readibility. As a group 
we want to go beyond poorly written game development tutorials 
by learning through practice and working together. We promote communication 
and commitment as the cornerstones of good development practices and want 
to develop a group of developers and game designers who agree.</p>

			<p>We are not the most talented programmers or designers, 
nor are the majority of us full time game makers, 
but here at Nigh Night Gaming Collective, 
what we love comes to life and becomes interactive.</p>

			<p>NNGC was founded by <a href="http://linkedin.com/pub/michael-perez/61/5ba/a54/"> Michael PÃ©rez </a> in 2013.</p>
