			<h4><a href="https://github.com/NighNightGaming/unholy_ghosts">unHoly Ghosts</a></h4>
			<p>An angry ghost stumbles upon a funeral. Indignated that mortals walk on its home, the ghost posseses the corpes. It breaks through the funeral and begins to terrorize the graveyard. In mortal form, the player is vulnerable to the attacks of the mortals. If his health (or plasma-link) is depleted entirely, the ghost is ejected from the host. In ghost form, the player is under a time limit to find a new host while also in danger of being grabbed by one of the "demon hands." While technically, lives are infinite, the amount of demon hands grows exponentially with the amount of "ejections."</p>
			<p>Check out the development at our github <a href="https://github.com/NighNightGaming/unholy_ghosts">here.</a></p>

			<p>Nigh Night Gaming Collective (NNGC) is an open group of 
developers and artists of varying skills focusing on 
original, interesting, and, most importantly, fun game development.</p>

			<p>NNGC is dedicated to openness and readibility. As a group 
we want to go beyond poorly written game development tutorials 
by learning through practice and working together. We promote communication 
and commitment as the cornerstones of good development practices and want 
to develop a group of developers and game designers who agree.</p>

			<p>We are not the most talented programmers or designers, 
nor are the majority of us full time game makers, 
but here at Nigh Night Gaming Collective, 
what we love comes to life and becomes interactive.</p>

			<p>NNGC was founded by <a href="http://linkedin.com/pub/michael-perez/61/5ba/a54/"> Michael PÃ©rez </a> in 2013.</p>
